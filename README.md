A full-stack dashboard built with the MERN stack, and a heavier focus on the front-end development.  Backend data was supplied with a pre-existing data set for products, and MUI DataGrid for customer data.  

Front-end is heavy on React, MUI components, and CSS.

The biggest challenge for me with this project is the complexity of the layout (many custom components built, as well as using MUI for the first time).

NOTE: May load very slowly first time, even giving a 404 at first.  Due to the way Render deploys, please be patient.  Thank you!
